('The Eclogues','Virgil','Virgil’s Eclogues, also known as the Bucolics, is a collection of ten pastoral poems written in Latin during the first century BC. It’s among the most famous cycles of poetry in Latin literature. The Eclogues were written at a time of political and social upheaval in Rome, and they reflect Virgil’s concerns about the state of the Roman Republic under Augustus’s rule. The poems are set in an idealized, rural landscape and feature shepherds engaging in conversations about love, politics, and the natural world. The characters and themes are often allegorical, representing contemporary political figures and events in a veiled manner. The poems also draw on the pastoral tradition established by earlier Greek poets like Theocritus. The first eclogue introduces two shepherds, Tityrus and Meliboeus, who discuss the impact of recent land expropriations on their lives. Other eclogues explore themes such as unrequited love, the idyllic rural life, and the effects of political turmoil on the countryside.',9.99,'/images/aaa063c7-d673-46f6-82be-9f51281d6c15.jpg','/files/163d52b3-1217-4404-b1f3-321b7aaa1ba2.epub'),
('Metropolis','Thea von Harbou','Set in a futuristic dystopian city, Metropolis revolves around the stark divide between the affluent ruling class, who reside in luxurious skyscrapers above ground, and the oppressed working class laboring in dismal conditions below. The city is run by the powerful Joh Fredersen, who oversees the vast industrial complex that sustains the city. The plot takes a dramatic turn when Joh Fredersen’s son, Freder, discovers the harsh reality of the workers’ plight and becomes determined to bridge the gap between the two classes. As Freder delves deeper into the city’s secrets, he encounters Maria, a compassionate woman advocating for workers’ rights. The plot thickens as the city faces the impending threat of rebellion from the oppressed laborers. Joh Fredersen, driven by his desire to maintain control, enlists the help of the brilliant scientist Rotwang to develop a humanoid robot with Maria’s likeness. The robot is intended to manipulate and control the workers, escalating tensions and leading to a dramatic climax that explores themes of class struggle, technology, and the consequences of unchecked industrialization. Metropolis was first serialized in the German magazine Das illustrierte Blatt in 1926 and published as a book by August Scherl Verlag that same year. Von Harbau also wrote the screenplay for the groundbreaking film of the same name directed by her husband, Fritz Lang. Both the novel and the film were developed simultaneously, with the screenplay closely following the narrative of the novel.',9.99,'/images/7d70b2c0-33f6-4b49-a74f-6be04cfb0542.jpg','/files/be1496cc-3a07-47d6-b356-0bbe1c1b6ec3.epub'),
('Backwater','Dorothy M. Richardson','Backwater is the second installment in Dorothy M. Richardson’s pioneering sequence of autobiographical novels, Pilgrimage. Returning from Germany after the events of the first novel, Pointed Roofs, Miriam Henderson, now eighteen years old, takes a position as a teacher in a North London suburban school. While there she must manage her doubts and fears about her own future, while negotiating changes and difficulties in her own family.',9.99,'/images/e8c721d1-7c2a-4d79-953c-a454aba36382.jpg','/files/4c8c5424-0e4d-47cf-a418-8f11a985a2b2.epub'),
('The House of the Wolfings','William Morris','The House of the Wolfings tells the tale of a band of German Goths living in a wood they call the Mark. Their lives are idyllic until the long shadow of the Roman Empire threatens the peace in their land. Thiodolf, the leader of the Wolfings and a descendant of the ancient gods, must rally the surrounding tribes to defend their home and way of life. Like much of Morris’s work, The House of the Wolfings is written in a purposefully-archaic prose style, with significant portions of the dialog presented in verse. His goal was to explore the language and atmosphere of the medieval ages that so fascinated him, and the result is a uniquely rich and evocative narrative. Morris also uses the contrast of the content and agrarian Goths with the violent and rapacious city-dwelling Romans to invoke one of his favorite themes: socialism. Our heroes are happy to live in an egalitarian society, with men and women valued equally, and close to the land and tradition. Meanwhile, the Roman invaders, unhappy in their modern lifestyle, seek personal glory and ever more booty, leading to nothing but destruction. The novel, as a work grounded in reality but with an aspect of the magical or supernatural, is one of the forefathers of modern fantasy fiction. Indeed, The House of the Wolfings was a direct inspiration to J. R. R. Tolkien, who, acknowledging such in a 1960s letter, drew from it concepts as diverse as mysterious dwarves who are talented armorers, to tribes of Goths reminiscent of Tolkien’s Rohan, to a deep forest named Mirkwood.',9.99,'/images/02be0031-1e26-410a-b9d5-c3ff1f494270.jpg','/files/32fb2bd5-6981-4f58-a906-b261f020f482.epub'),
('Miss Marjoribanks','Margaret Oliphant','When Dr. Marjoribanks’s wife dies, his teenage daughter makes it her purpose in life “to be a comfort to dear papa.” At least, Lucilla thinks, ten years of such devotion might suffice, by which time she might have begun to “go off.” But beneath this grand intention lies a yet more ambitious plan: to revolutionize the moribund and constricted social life of Carlingford. She is remarkably well-endowed for such an aspiration, being of able mind and otherwise ample proportions. As Lucilla’s plans unfold, her Thursday evenings become a great success, and draw into her sphere characters whose lives now become deeply entwined with her own. Naturally, complications of various kinds arise leading to a crisis which taxes Lucilla’s gifts and genius to the utmost. The novel falls into two distinct parts, for after this first phase of Lucilla’s career reaches its denouement, Oliphant skips over ten years, to that very point at which Lucilla feared she would be “going off.” Events in these more mature years of Miss Marjoribanks’s life are set in the time corresponding roughly to that of Salem Chapel, an earlier work in the Chronicles of Carlingford. Modern appreciation of the novel rose with Q. D. Leavis’s introduction to a 1969 reprint, in which he suggested that Oliphant is the “missing link” between Jane Austen and George Eliot. There is something about Lucilla that reminds the reader of Emma, and which informs the character of Dorothea who was to appear a few years after Miss Marjoribanks in Eliot’s classic, Middlemarch. With its fine observations, fully realized characters, and sharp but dry humor, Miss Marjoribanks remains something of a neglected masterpiece of nineteenth century fiction. Yet as R. C. Terry writes in his book Victorian Popular Fiction, it is “the most sophisticated and charming of the series, and a novel that can stand comparison with the best contemporary novels of its kind.”',9.99,'/images/88f1ef56-ae23-45c8-a6c1-0c4625d6123e.jpg','/files/d9675022-a3f8-4438-baac-37e17934a8a5.epub'),
('The Mucker','Edgar Rice Burroughs','Billy Byrne, a rough and unpolished young man, finds himself entangled in a series of unexpected events that lead him from the urban jungle of early 20th century Chicago to the high seas and, eventually, to revolutionary Mexico. When he and a wealthy heiress named Barbara Harding become shipwrecked on a remote island, the harsh realities of survival force Billy to reevaluate his values and confront his own identity. He undergoes a profound transformation, discovering hidden depths of courage, compassion, and integrity within himself. As Billy’s character evolves, so does the dynamic between him and Barbara, creating a captivating narrative that explores themes of identity, redemption, and the impact of one’s past choices. Edgar Rice Burroughs weaves a compelling narrative that keeps readers on the edge of their seats, blending elements of action, suspense, and introspection. Billy’s internal conflict adds depth to the story, making it more than just a typical adventure tale. “The Mucker” was first serialized in 1914 in All-Story Cavalier Weekly 1914; “Return of The Mucker” appeared in All-Story Weekly in 1916. The two stories were combined into a book by A. C. McClurg & Co. in 1921.',9.99,'/images/efd12dc9-41ce-4d02-bd8a-324f157e6c13.jpg','/files/02e32cc3-fe3f-4b82-8b7e-60f3f60cf753.epub'),
('The Wrong Letter','Walter S. Masterman','While in his office, Superintendent Sinclair receives a phone call from an unknown caller, who claims that they murdered the Home Secretary in his home. Together with Sylvester Collins, an eccentric sleuth, Sinclair goes to the Home Secretary’s house to investigate the truth of the call, only to discover the body of the victim in a locked room. Is this a bizarre suicide, or is it a skillfully-executed murder? This is the question the duo have in mind as their investigation digs deeper into the victim’s relationship with his daughter and estranged son. Written in 1926, the peak of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, Walter S. Masterman’s The Wrong Letter follows a typical whodunit structure centered around a locked-room mystery, yet the novel stands out with its intricate clue-puzzle and its fresh take on the classical detective-and-assistant dynamic. While Collins and Sinclair’s relationship initially resembles Sherlock Holmes and Watson’s, it soon evolves beyond a mere archetype.',9.99,'/images/971f5588-7629-4aae-8675-49a51a3070c5.jpg','/files/b24f7eb2-5094-49a7-89ca-6af41375b395.epub'),
('The Head of Kay’s','P. G. Wodehouse','The Head of Kay’s is a chronicle of the adventures of two boys, Fenn and Kennedy, who conspire to replace their ill-mannered headmaster, Mr. Kay. On the way, the gregarious boys are involved in cricket and rugby matches between the houses, a music concert gone wrong, and other adventures in this exciting story exploring the lives and relationships of boarding school boys. The book was first serialized in The Captain from October 1904 to March 1905 before being published as a book in 1905. Released in the early part of his prolific career, it is the fifth book by P. G. Wodehouse.',9.99,'/images/0e3f6161-2ece-4fe8-8944-75e0715e742c.jpg','/files/ac433709-3b58-4e71-a49e-021e20746779.epub'),
('Theodore Savage','Cicely Hamilton','Theodore Savage opens with the title character, an office worker enjoying a comfortable life, anticipating his wedding. There are rumors of impending war; the people are excited, sure of their cause. When the war finally begins, Savage is called away to manage food distribution. But disaster soon follows as total war is unleashed on the country. As he adapts to a hard new life of man against man, fighting for ever-more-scarce resources, Savage wonders if he’ll ever return to his old life again. Cicely Hamilton wrote Theodore Savage shortly after the First World War, mindful of the terrifying destruction wrought with its poison gas and mechanized weaponry. She asserts that mankind is destined to become a slave to the things it creates, and advancement of knowledge will be its downfall. One reviewer found the story lacking in detail and credibility, and thought it too far-fetched that the whole world would collapse to a primitive state with no one to carry on the torch of knowledge. Another reviewer questioned the assertion that disaster follows inevitably from scientific knowledge in a never-ending cycle. But from an artistic point of view, the novel was regarded as imaginative and clever, despite its subject matter, which was rather dreary for a world still recovering from the Great War.',9.99,'/images/0db6a023-3176-4cd5-88b5-54d95f0ee96e.jpg','/files/642abeef-9a1f-44a0-8cac-a9573ed5f473.epub'),
('The Perpetual Curate','Margaret Oliphant','Frank Wentworth is the Perpetual Curate; the daughters of the Wodehouse family are his special friends; and his church clerk, Mr. Elsworthy, runs the local shop. And each family, it appears, has its “skeleton in the cupboard.” Mr. Wentworth is familiar to readers of the Chronicles of Carlingford: he is among the first characters introduced in the series, and has been a constant presence as a prominent member of society in the small town. But there is a new Rector in Carlingford, and this circumstance brings with it the first cloud in the otherwise clear skies of Mr. Wentworth’s station in life. To be sure, a “perpetual curate”—an Anglican clergyman serving a church without any accompanying parish—does not enjoy a lofty position. But his mission to the working-class poor near his church brings him satisfaction, fulfillment, and a more intimate relationship with the younger Miss Wodehouse, who joins in the work. All this is threatened by the new Rector, who is adamant that only a mission authorized by him should be carried out in his parish. That is only the beginning of the Perpetual Curate’s troubles, however. Those “skeletons” in the three families prove to be very much active, and involve Frank in affairs that not only disturb his working life, but threaten to bring it to an end altogether. Once again Margaret Oliphant brings her particular skills to bear on some of the female characters in the novel. The elder Miss Wodehouse, each of Frank’s maiden aunts, and especially Mrs. Morgan, the newly married and middle-aged wife of the new Rector, are deftly portrayed. Oliphant also weaves in some salient features of Victorian church life, from low church Anglican evangelicalism, to high church Anglo-Catholicism, to the lure of conversion to Rome itself—each without the degree prejudice and caricature that sometimes emerges even in the work of Anthony Trollope, whose work bears comparison with Oliphant’s. The high drama of this carefully plotted novel attests to Oliphant’s affection for her creation of Frank Wentworth: “I mean to bestow the very greatest care upon him,” she wrote to her publisher. As a result, The Perpetual Curate remains one of Oliphant’s most popular works.',9.99,'/images/0bb6e6d5-b083-43c0-a0a2-aecdd332ae92.jpg','/files/cf6ce0a7-e040-43e6-aefa-65a3286b8f44.epub'),
('Principia Ethica','G. E. Moore','Principia Ethica is a foundational text in the analytic tradition of ethical theory and G. E. Moore’s most influential book. In it, he defines the subject of ethics as the general enquiry into the question “what is good?” and famously contends that the predicate “good” is indefinable. Moore claims that whatever definition is offered of the predicate, “it may be always asked, with significance, of the complex so defined, whether it is itself good,” an argument that would later come to be known as the “open question” argument. To fail to accept its conclusion and instead to identify “good” with some other quality or list of qualities is, according to Moore, to commit the error that he names the “naturalistic fallacy.” The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing ethical theories that Moore finds defective. First he addresses “naturalistic” theories, which define good in terms of properties that exist in time and can be experienced; among these theories his primary foci are the “evolutionary” ethics of Herbert Spencer and the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill. Moore then criticizes the “non-naturalistic” strand of ethics that defines “good” in terms of a supersensible reality and whose representatives include Kant, Spinoza and the Stoics. While identifying different errors in each of the theories he considers, Moore holds all of them to commit the naturalistic fallacy. The final two chapters of the book develop Moore’s positive ethical vision, discussing respectively the conditions under which conduct is to be considered good or bad, and the notion of the “highest good” or the “Ideal.” He supports the standard consequentialist thesis that the right action is that which results in the most good. However, in his view “the most good” ought to be determined by reference to a set of intrinsic goods in which aesthetic experiences and personal affections are foregrounded, in contrast to hedonistic theories that recognize value only in pleasure or the absence of pain. Moore’s declarations concerning what has intrinsic value influenced members of the Bloomsbury Group such as Lytton Strachey, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and John Maynard Keynes. In her first novel, The Voyage Out, Virginia Woolf has her character Helen Ambrose read Principia Ethica, while Strachey wrote to Moore that he considered the publication date of Principia Ethica to be the “beginning of the Age of Reason.” Although Moore would later disown many of its main contentions and argumentative strategies as confused, Principia Ethica continues to be acknowledged as a pioneering work of ethics and of analytic philosophy. In affirming the importance of understanding the meaning of ethical judgments before progressing to investigations of their truth, the treatise also laid the groundwork for the mid-century linguistic turn in ethics and the contemporary distinction between normative ethics and meta-ethics.',9.99,'/images/66e1919d-a6b0-45e3-9def-dab39b52a210.jpg','/files/6068a003-69af-45c7-80f7-a3555f02186e.epub'),
('The Water-Babies','Charles Kingsley','Uneducated and regularly mistreated by his master, his filth only matched by his moral and spiritual baseness, Tom is a typical Victorian chimney sweep. While on a special job at a noble’s estate, prejudice pins a crime on him and he flees in fear of retaliation. The chase eventually takes him to a stream in which he bathes for the first time and, doing so, finds himself reborn as a water-baby. Now a denizen of the fairy world, so close yet so alien to ours, Tom begins a journey of moral and spiritual growth. Through the teachings of the fairies, he is made aware of the consequences of his own cruelty and ignorance, for which he learns to own up to, and ultimately understands the importance of doing as he would be done by. This is the premise of The Water-Babies, a children’s book written by Charles Kingsley in 1863. As a man of the cloth who wrote children’s fiction with a taste for science, Kingsley bears similarities to Lewis Carroll, whose Alice’ Adventures in Wonderland would be published two years after The Water-Babies. But while Carroll eschewed didacticism, Kingsley embraced it. Kingsley had a clear moral purpose in writing his book. Like many of his contemporaries, he believed in the importance of providing children with a moral education—the nature thereof being often in contention. In particular, Kingsley clashed with the American author Samuel Goodrich, who was contemptuous of fantasy and insisted that children be given only facts and taught to reach objective truth through empirical means. Kingsley, in opposition, held that children need a balanced manner of apprehension: limiting them to mere facts would not automatically provide them with the insight and critical thinking needed to produce anything useful. Fantasy adds an element of wonder to education, allowing children to engage and play with ideas, and opening their minds to various, sometimes unconventional, inferences. Goodrich is lampooned in the book as Cousin Cramchild; the consequences of his methods are shown through vegetable children who are “all heads and no bodies”: full of information yet lacking in wisdom and unable to do anything at all. Kingsley also had a scientific interest in writing his book. A well-rounded moral education, he thought, required an alliance of faith and science, something he understood as a clergyman. In The Water-Babies, he explores the harmony between faith and science, using fantasy and humor to illustrate his views and introduce children to the scientific method as well as Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection. But The Water-Babies is not just a work of whimsy for children. Like Carroll, Kingsley imparts darkness into his work. While he is careful not to shock his intended audience, adults can easily pick up that the water-babies were once children who died from abuse or neglect. Tom leaves his dirty husk behind so his true self can finally be free to wander and wonder, to learn and grow, to find in the afterlife as a fairy what he had been denied in life as a human—a fulfillment of the Christian promise. Under the playfulness of the tale lie the horrors of the Industrial Revolution that forced so many into child labor. Kingsley’s outrage, however, didn’t go unheard: The Water-Babies became a bestseller, echoing the sentiment of other reformers. The Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act, which aimed to improve the conditions of chimney sweeps, passed a year after the book’s publication. It is no exaggeration to say that Kingsley, through his book, helped to make a difference for many children and young men.',9.99,'/images/ec64a154-b814-412e-916d-939cc9d49f9f.jpg','/files/8282a382-be3b-47f5-acc9-f88afe49358e.epub'),
('News from Nowhere','William Morris','William Guest wakes up to find himself transported to a future utopian society. This bucolic society functions despite the absence of private property, marriage, prisons, courts, schools, and central government. The people are happy, healthy, and hard working. As he travels through this revitalized England, he discovers how this society works and how it came to be. Edward Bellamy’s 1888 utopian novel Looking Backward describes a very different future utopian society, where machines have reduced the need to work, and strong government redistributive policies have eliminated inequality. Morris, in reviewing that book, disagreed with its conclusions, and News from Nowhere presents his competing utopian vision. In Morris’ ideal society, work isn’t something to be eliminated by machines, but rather a way to exercise creativity and to grow closer both to nature and to others. Work is performed not through coercion but through genuine appreciation. Morris emphasizes the need to change not only the material aspects of capitalism, but also the way society views work, the environment, and the purpose of life. News from Nowhere is considered a landmark novel in anarchism and influenced many early twentieth century socialists. The first edition was serialized in the Commonweal in 1890, before being published as a book, with some editorial changes, in 1891. In 1892, Morris published a final edition as one of the first books printed by his soon-to-be-legendary publishing company, the Kelmscott Press. It was printed by hand at his own home, and decorated and typeset by him using a typeface he designed.',9.99,'/images/894da240-4593-4ba1-885b-27ae573ec7b0.jpg','/files/22090894-d37a-4f3b-935f-b876ac50ae0b.epub'),
('Through the Brazilian Wilderness','Theodore Roosevelt','After failing to win a third term in the elections of 1912, former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt planned a speaking trip to Argentina and Brazil and a cruise up the Amazon. The government of Brazil suggested that Roosevelt join the famous Brazilian explorer Cândido Rondon in an expedition down the recently discovered River of Doubt. Roosevelt accepted the invitation and, accompanied by his son Kermit, reached the river with Rondon on February 27, 1914. From the beginning, the expedition was fraught with difficulties, including disease, lack of supplies, and hostility from the local tribes. Roosevelt nearly died from an infected wound. This book is his account of the expedition, which, despite its problems, managed to map parts of the river and to discover several previously-unknown species of animals and plants. The River of Doubt is now called Rio Roosevelt.',9.99,'/images/c052b471-8689-45e5-9f67-2ec87fcc57e5.jpg','/files/3df04a97-61b5-4df1-82d0-48be6107ad84.epub'),
('The Blazing World','Margaret Cavendish','A young lady is abducted by sea and finds herself transported into a new world where the blazing stars make night as bright as day. She marries the world’s Emperor, becoming Empress, and through consultation with many creatures and immaterial spirits she elaborates on contemporary scientific and philosophical topics. The story presents the view that a society with a unified language and religion can be made orderly under the rule of a benevolent monarch. Margaret Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle, plays her own part in the story by providing advice and showing the Empress around her own world. The Blazing World was written in 1666, a few years after the restoration of the British monarchy. With its fantastic setting, the book is considered an early forerunner of the science fiction genre.',9.99,'/images/c8da7e1d-b771-480f-aa86-126e0c9e372d.jpg','/files/05d3f05b-9382-45fe-816d-07545da9627f.epub'),
('Salammbô','Gustave Flaubert','Carthage’s struggle–or rather, the struggle of its hired mercenaries–against its enemies in the First Punic War has ended in success. But now the mercenaries are expecting their fee, and Carthage isn’t willing or able to cover its debts. Incensed, the mercenaries are easily lead into rebellion by a pair of their own, each of whom have their own reasons to launch an attack. Spendius has escaped from slavery in Carthage and wants nothing more than to land a damaging blow on the mighty city-state, while Matho is besotted with the enigmatic and otherworldly priestess Salammbô. Flaubert’s vision of the Mercenary War is broadly compatible with historical sources, but never allows accuracy to get in the way of a good story. While characters such as Matho, Spendius and Hamilcar existed and are well-documented in sources such as Polybius’ Histories, Salammbô as a character, along with her surroundings, allow Flaubert to paint a more sensual view of Carthagian ritual and excess. He also didn’t hold back with his descriptions of the intense violence of both the battles and the sacrifices required by the gods. Salammbô followed the success of Madame Bovary, and marked a departure in style for Flaubert. It was, however, another commercial success, and led to a new appreciation in French society for the novel’s setting. The story has been reworked for different media many times over the intervening years, and the character of Salammbô even makes a memorable appearance in the classic film Citizen Kane.',9.99,'/images/911c369d-ede7-4b40-b9fa-07599c45ed82.jpg','/files/d590d0d3-97a5-48d9-b384-cd40c9ccc4a6.epub'),

('Festus','Philip James Bailey','Festus is a dramatic narrative poem written by Philip James Bailey, first published in 1839. Instead of adhering to a traditional linear plot structure, the work presents a series of loosely connected episodes, dialogues, and encounters that collectively form the spiritual and philosophical journey of its central character, Festus. Festus embarks on a metaphysical journey through various realms and encounters a wide array of allegorical and mythological figures, representing different facets of human experience, morality, and the eternal struggle between good and evil. Through his interactions with these characters, Festus engages in discussions on topics such as love, death, faith, and the nature of reality. Lucifer is a constant presence on the protagonist’s journey. His interactions with Festus serve as a means of exploring the conflict between good and evil, as well as the challenges and choices that individuals face in their pursuit of enlightenment; he represents the adversarial force that seeks to divert Festus from his path, tempting him with worldly pleasures, doubts, and distractions. Festus was extremely popular in its day, and greatly admired by contemporary poets like Tennyson and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It went through various editions over the years as Bailey continued appending verbatim extracts from his later, less popular poems, until the final edition of 1889 ran over 40,000 lines. This Standard Ebooks edition is based on the 1845 first American edition, which is the last edition to contain material wholly original to Festus.',9.99,'/images/158408b4-2aab-4a6f-918c-8d4a7b5d8fe7.jpg','/files/da91153b-6386-4075-880f-9736b0b4bbbd.epub'),
('The Rector and The Doctor’s Family','Margaret Oliphant','When the stories that became the Chronicles of Carlingford series first appeared anonymously, speculation had it that they were the work of George Eliot. The connection was a natural one. Only a few years earlier, Eliot’s Scenes of Clerical Life had appeared in Blackwood’s Magazine. The Carlingford stories, too, were originally published in Blackwood’s, and they had much to do with ecclesiastical affairs in the town. Eliot did not feel flattered by the attribution, although her own work and that of Margaret Oliphant continued to have fascinating connections. The two novellas joined in this ebook (as they were in their signed publication of 1863) introduce readers to the sleepy town of Carlingford with its intricate and layered social life. The Rector tells the story of an Oxford scholar in holy orders, embarking on parish ministry only in middle age. The demands of the role expose his personal inadequacies, and provoke his attempts to come to terms with them. The central character of The Doctor’s Family is Dr. Rider, an unexceptional young medical man. His dissolute older brother, Fred, has once before ruined his nascent career, and Fred’s arrival in Carlingford from Australia threatens to do so again—all the moreso when his family, until then unknown to Dr. Rider, shows up in town as well. Particularly Fred’s waif-like but efficient sister-in-law, really a “little autocrat,” claims Dr. Rider’s attention in unexpected ways. The hopes and conflicts of these ordinary men provide the details for the portraits which Oliphant paints on the canvas of Carlingford life. She took some inspiration for these chronicles from the Barsetshire novels of Anthony Trollope, which had by this time become great successes. While the debt is obvious, Oliphant’s vision—both socially and artistically—differs significantly from Trollope’s. Not only does Oliphant attend to aspects of society in which Trollope had little interest, but she also writes with a woman’s insight, and a flair arising out of her experience as the competent manager of her own troubled family.',9.99,'/images/263e5a64-921f-47be-8fe6-0d369d3c0fa1.jpg','/files/6cc2d796-10e3-4c9f-87cb-6745267f602f.epub'),
('Salem Chapel','Margaret Oliphant','The sleepy town of Carlingford includes two Anglican churches and one dissenting chapel. They draw their congregations from very different strata of society, even in as small a town as theirs. Arthur Vincent has just been called as pastor to his first charge, Salem Chapel. He’s a young man of ability, but he’s also prideful and ambitious. As his ministry settles, he finds himself both repulsed by his crude and claustrophobic flock, and attracted by the brighter members of the town’s society. Vincent’s social entanglements complicate his ministry in predictable ways. What could not be predicted, however, are the crises into which his wider family is plunged as their lives intertwine with those of strangers. This second Chronicle of Carlingford brings readers into a realm of society which is seldom glimpsed in Victorian fiction: the lives of shopkeepers, dissenting thought and culture, the distinctive piety and “tea meetings” of the Chapel—all of which finds its closest parallels in the later fiction of Mark Rutherford. While Salem Chapel may not yet be the artistic high point of the series, still, as one critic puts it, with it “Mrs. Oliphant gave the surest sign of genius.”',9.99,'/images/ca1a6d55-1dd5-4e56-92ca-7962ab5666aa.jpg','/files/c2aea92b-41fa-4a4d-bda8-72b0914ae733.epub'),
('Typee','Herman Melville','Tom and fellow sailor Toby escape from their duties onboard a whaling ship and fall in with savages on Nukuheva (Nuku Hiva) of the Marquesas Islands. The islanders welcome them to their tropical paradise, but the two runaways must remain on guard to find out if these savages are truly friends or foes. Typee was Melville’s first novel, written after his own voyages and experiences on a whaling ship to the Marquesas and beyond. Tom was a stand-in for the author himself, whose in-depth reports on the islanders and their way of life in this novel caused it to be an invaluable guide for travelers visiting the Marquesas. This seafaring adventure was immediately well-received, and, followed by other novels of his continuing voyages, helped launch Melville’s writing career. Presented here is the 1892 edition, which includes passages cut from earlier editions that were critical of aspects of Christian missions to the Polynesian islands, and were not well-regarded by contemporary audiences.',9.99,'/images/262e1e26-87f3-4180-9773-d66cdf8db271.jpg','/files/1a8fe8ec-41dd-46a0-a8fb-03c414b3bf76.epub'),
('The Genealogy of Morals','Friedrich Nietzsche','First published in German in 1887, The Genealogy of Morals was intended by Nietzsche as a clarification and supplement to his 1882 treatise Beyond Good and Evil. In his last published work, Ecce Homo, Nietzsche described the essays constituting The Genealogy of Morals as “three decisive overtures on the part of a psychologist to a revaluation of all values” and claimed that they were “as regards expression, aspiration, and the art of the unexpected, perhaps the most curious things that have ever been written.” While this self-assessment is probably an overstatement, The Genealogy of Morals is widely acknowledged to be a unique contribution to philosophy in both content and style. The style is intentionally difficult, contrived by turns to embolden, to repel, and to mislead. “In each case,” he wrote, “the beginning is calculated to mystify; it is cool, scientific, even ironical, intentionally thrust to the fore, intentionally reticent. … At the end, in each case, amid fearful thunderclaps, a new truth shines out between thick clouds.” In the first essay, Nietzsche introduces the idea of ressentiment, the source and basis (he contends) of the Christian and Jewish religions and the fundamental psychological mechanism of the associated “slave revolt” in morality, an evaluative inversion performed by the oppressed to compensate for, and to enable themselves to endure, their powerlessness and its attendant frustration. Nietzsche contrasts “noble” values, the central opposition of which is that of “good” and “bad” as applied to human beings themselves, with “slavish” values, the central opposition of which is “good” and “evil” as applied to actions. The vaunting of the latter opposition in Christianity represents, according to Nietzsche, “the great insurrection against the dominion of noble values” common to pagan Rome and ancient Greece. The second essay begins with a discussion of promising and the value of forgetfulness, then traces the origins of guilt and bad conscience to self-directed cruelty, the inward application of a naturally brutal animal instinct that has been prevented from finding outward expression. Nietzsche goes on to supply an analysis of the origin and purpose of punishment in human societies. “Cruelty,” Nietzsche asserts controversially in Ecce Homo, “is here exposed, for the first time, as one of the oldest and most indispensable elements in the foundation of culture.” “Ascetic ideals,” whose “three great pomp words are poverty, humility, and chastity,” are the subject of the third essay, the longest of the work and perhaps its rhetorical high point. Nietzsche here considers the ascetic ideal as instantiated by artists, scholars, and priests, noting differences between the three groups in the ideal’s expression and effects. He asks why ascetic ideals are so powerful, given that they are, as he believes, generally detrimental to human health and well-being, concluding that the ascetic ideal’s power arose from a historical dearth of competing ideals and that “man will wish Nothingness rather than not wish at all.” Contending with the popular perception that a scientific outlook is in principle opposed to religiosity, the latter being the natural home of ascetic ideals, Nietzsche deduces from his analysis of the “will to truth” that the relation of science to ascetic ideals themselves is not at all antagonistic. In fact, “science represents the progressive force in the inner evolution of that ideal”; even further, “valuation of ascetic ideals inevitably entails valuation of science.” Nietzsche also interestingly implicates himself and his own Genealogy in the preservation of ascetic ideals, identifying the bond between ideal and philosophy itself as very strong. The third essay is notable for having been singled out by Nietzsche as an exercise in exposition of an aphorism. Scholars, notably Christopher Janaway, have disputed whether the aphorism on which the essay is supposedly a commentary is the epigraph from his previous work Thus Spake Zarathustra, or instead the first of the essay’s numbered paragraphs. Nietzsche’s turbulent, haphazardly erudite style has contributed to his mixed reception in philosophy and the broader culture, and to the understanding that he was just as concerned with literary virtuosity as philosophical clarity. Nevertheless, despite the literary complexity of his work, it’s still possible to ask of its content—as Bertrand Russell did in his History of Western Philosophy—“What are we to think of Nietzsche’s doctrines? How far are they true? Are they in any degree useful? Is there in them anything objective, or are they the mere power-fantasies of an invalid?” “There is no escaping Nietzsche,” wrote H. L. Mencken in 1908. “You may hold him a hissing and a mocking and lift your virtuous skirts as you pass him by, but his roar is in your ears and his blasphemies sink into your mind.” Whether its blasphemous sympathies attract or repel us, and whether its analysis ultimately unsettles or only reinforces our initial ethical presuppositions, the Genealogy of Morals remains an essential work in the history of ideas whose moral and political relevance shows little sign of diminishing.',9.99,'/images/5ba36fd0-367e-4ec1-b9c4-0dec1502ec97.jpg','/files/d1963a67-d6fa-4b47-b3cb-2cd369d771a1.epub'),
('Sylvie and Bruno','Lewis Carroll','In Sylvie and Bruno, the titular characters serve as the connection between the novel’s two settings: Outland, a fictional land in which the children’s father is the Warden, and the real world, Victorian England. After their father is betrayed by their uncle, the family leaves their home and travels to different places to meet interesting and unusual characters. The part of the story set in England is social commentary, with the characters discussing philosophy, religion, morals, and economics. The part set in Outland is a fairy tale akin to Carroll’s much more popular works, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. The novel is a combination of two previous published short stories, plus ideas Carroll had collected throughout the years. This pedigree results in a fairly scattered plot, and the book was not well received by contemporary critics or audiences.',9.99,'/images/a0984cc6-e290-4043-bde9-b5595eccafdd.jpg','/files/5392f5ef-d238-4851-8bbf-539e95386c3a.epub'),
('The Consolation of Philosophy','Boethius','The Consolation of Philosophy is the best-known work of Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, a Roman statesman and scholar who lived at the intersection of the classical and medieval periods. Identified by fifteenth-century humanist Lorenzo Valla as “the last of the Romans and the first of the scholastics,” and by Gibbon in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as “the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman,” Boethius was born in Rome around 476 to an aristocratic family, received a thorough education in Greek and rose rapidly to the ranks of senator, master of offices, and sole consul. He combined public life with scholarly projects, aiming to bring Greek learning to the Latin-speaking world through his translations of and commentaries on major logical and philosophical texts, especially those of Aristotle. In 523, having publicly expressed support for a senator who had been accused of treason, Boethius was stripped of all honors and exiled to Pavia, where he composed the work translated into English as The Consolation of Philosophy. Boethius himself is one of the work’s two main characters. At its beginning, he sits in prison composing a song of lament at his unjust detention, surrounded by the Muses of Poetry. The figure of Philosophy then appears to him, a woman of supernatural appearance who banishes the Muses from Boethius’ cell and begins a dialogue with the prisoner. Diagnosing his condition as the dire result of forgetting the nature of the universe and of himself, Philosophy intends to palliate Boethius’ distress by returning his attention to the rational order and government of the universe. To this end she leads him through disquisitions on the nature of fortune, true and false happiness, fate and providence, and the relationship between free will and divine foreknowledge. With sections alternating between prose and verse, The Consolation of Philosophy serves as one of Western literature’s foremost examples of prosimetrical composition. It contains in total thirty-nine poems—or songs, as they are called in the present edition’s translation by H. R. James—leading scholar Joel Relihan to describe it as “the most prosimetric text of antiquity.” Prosimetrical form is associated with the tradition of Menippean satire, in which pretensions to wisdom and authority are ironized. Boethius’ use of this general form, as well as the variety of literary genres he incorporates into it, contributes to the complexity of the work’s interpretation; to what extent did he intend Philosophy’s arguments, and with them the authority of philosophy as a discipline, to be taken at face value? Relihan has interpreted the work as expressing a rejection of the possibility that philosophy might genuinely provide consolation to suffering human beings. In this view, the unsatisfactory quality of Philosophy’s arguments is a rhetorical strategy, in line with the author’s unstated Christian commitments, to shore up the idea that only faith in the Christian god can provide true consolation to the broken. In contrast, scholar John Marenbon writes that Boethius does not reject the aspirations of Philosophy to console, “as if its title had to be pronounced with ironic emphasis: ‘that’s the consolation you gain from philosophy!’,” but rather explores the limits of its power to do so in a lightly satirical style, an exploration that presupposes rather than questions the discipline’s real value. In this connection, T. F. Curley views the form of the Consolation as suggestive of the ancient antagonism between poetry and philosophy, with Boethius attempting neither to endorse one over the other nor to reject both in favor of the cross, but to reconcile them. The importance of Christianity to the work, as to Boethius’ life, is disputed: central sections of the text concern God, the “Divine,” and “Providence,” but seemingly only as represented in the Greek philosophical tradition; the dialogue proceeds without ever mentioning the Catholic faith of Boethius’s upbringing or his apparent adult conviction. Nevertheless, the work was interpreted in roundly Christian terms in the Middle Ages, and almost eight centuries after its composition Dante would refer to Boethius in the Divine Comedy as “the sainted soul, which the fallacious world / Makes manifest to him who listeneth well.” Unlike Boethius’ theological tractates and logical commentaries, the Consolation was immensely popular for many centuries, often described as a best-seller of its time. The popularity of the work is also attested in its translation history, having been rendered in English by King Alfred, Queen Elizabeth I, and Chaucer. Its popularity has waned with the secularization of the West, but The Consolation of Philosophy remains of interest today due to the enduring questions it raises concerning the nature of true happiness, the right attitude to suffering, the rational order of the universe, the relationship between poetry and philosophy, and the limits of philosophy itself. Gibbon is often quoted as having judged it to be “a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or Tully,” consonant with historian H. M. Barrett’s more recent assessment that “in [Boethius’] last book, there is a certain timeless quality that will protect it from ever going out of date.”',9.99,'/images/6e8067aa-7fc0-4bcc-99c6-2981e960f75e.jpg','/files/06e82d23-a172-4abc-b973-6ffe6fef0cc8.epub'),
('He Knew He Was Right','Anthony Trollope','While on travels in the Mandarin Islands, Louis Trevelyan meets and then, on return to England, marries Emily Rowley, the eldest daughter of the governor of the Islands. They seem ideally suited, but Emily’s mother spots a potential sore spot: they both like to have their “own way.” For two years, and with the birth of their child, all goes well. But when the philandering Colonel Osborne—a lifelong friend of Emily’s father—comes calling in the Trevelyan home, their equilibrium is disastrously unsettled. The young husband imperiously insists on the older man’s exclusion; the proud and insulted wife insists she has every right to see her father’s old friend in all innocence. This conflict sets in motion Anthony Trollope’s epic study of pride, forgiveness and its lack, and pathological jealousy. Louis Trevelyan is the “he” of the book’s title, and his monomaniacal journey into a psychological abyss is the novel’s central story. Equally, however, the book could have been titled She Knew She Was Right, as that captures Emily’s core conviction equally well. In his autobiography, Trollope made the frank confession: “I look upon the story as being nearly altogether bad.” He felt he had failed to create some sense of sympathy for the main protagonist that he had in mind at the story’s inception. Later critics haven’t agreed with Trollope’s judgment. His handling of Trevelyan’s mental claustrophobia and burgeoning paranoia is considered to be one of his finest achievements of psychological depiction in literature. Trollope also considered the novel’s rich and complex subplots to be more successful than its central story—another failing, in his estimation. Yet these subplots aren’t random tales bolted on to the main action: rather, each of the strands depicts characters who are headstrong, preferring their “own way,” and yet without the tragic consequences of Trevelyan’s story. They even hint at the possibility of redemption. Artistically, they also display a lightness of touch that counterbalances the darker main thread. Trollope includes a number of direct quotations from, and allusions to, Shakespeare’s tragedy Othello, another story of destructive and misplaced sexual jealousy. Trollope’s transformations of the older work demonstrate both his fine imagination and his assured technical skill in this extraordinary novel. Frank Kermode is certainly justified in calling He Knew He Was Right “in some respects [Trollope’s] most striking achievement.”',9.99,'/images/fb06faab-13e3-4d22-8619-a5a300cdb350.jpg','/files/75b6ee90-baec-40af-b751-bd19260586db.epub'),
('The Voyage of the Beagle','Charles Darwin','In 1831, the twenty-two-year old Charles Darwin embarked on the Royal Navy ship H.M.S. Beagle as it set off on what was to be a five-year-long surveying expedition around South America and across the Pacific. Darwin was employed officially as a naturalist and geologist to assist in the survey, but unofficially as a companion to the captain, Robert Fitz Roy. Darwin was a keen and intelligent observer, and made a number of discoveries on the journey, including the observations at the Galapagos Archipelago which eventually led him to his theory of evolution (later outlined in The Origin of Species). His voyage across the Pacific also led him to propose a now largely-accepted theory of the formation of coral atolls. Darwin submitted his journal and notes as part of the official report of the expedition, but in 1839 he published a more readable account of his experiences in this book, initially titled Journal of Researches Into the Natural History and Geology of the Countries Visited During the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle Round the World Under the Command of Capt. Fitz Roy, R.N.. The book quickly became very popular, and the publisher had to release a second edition later the same year. The revised and much simpler title The Voyage of the Beagle was only given to the work in 1905. Adding to the interest of Darwin’s detailed and thorough observations of nature and geology are his deeply critical remarks on the institution of slavery, which he witnessed during his time in Brazil. This of course was three decades before the Civil War in the United States which was fought over that issue.',9.99,'/images/26ac9eb3-5ad3-445b-a7dd-0cda0eadc0c3.jpg','/files/e5816d0f-841e-453a-be9a-8d008223c376.epub'),

The second is set on the Aran Islands, where a woman waits for news of her son, who is missing at sea.

While Ambrose has trouble meeting the school’s expectations, he reaches back in his memory to a time with his father and their visit to an old Welsh farmer who had an ancient holy cup. This cup opens up a mystical world of beauty and splendor to Ambrose, which provides an escape from his troubled life. This book is considered a fantasy leaning on the theme of a holy grail.

Soon after his departure he returns back home to England unexpectedly early and deeply unwell, and so it’s down to his son John to piece together what happened during his fleeting visit to Erewhon. Written nearly thirty years after the first book, Erewhon Revisited is Samuel Butler’s attempt to reason about the ongoing effect Higgs’ first visit—and dramatic exit—would have had on the closed society of Erewhon. The playful satire of the first book remains, but this time focused on a new target: religion. This focus did the book no favors among the establishment of the day, but after partnering with George Bernard Shaw’s imprint it was finally published in 1901.

('Pragmatism','William James','Over the course of eight lectures originally delivered during the winter of 1906 and 1907 William James describes and defends the theory of pragmatism. Expanding on the earlier works of John Dewey and F. C. S. Schiller, James begins by presenting two competing views of the universe. The “rational” view treats everything as being derived from an absolute truth. Typically this view is based on religious grounds, and the theories need not bear any relation to the imperfect world in which we live. James contends that this is not a useful world view, as it is not applicable to our everyday lives. On the other hand, the “empirical” view considers as admissible only facts that have been materially verified. This view, while practical and useful, neglects anything that cannot be measured. It is fatalistic, and often pessimistic, reducing mankind to nothing more than an advanced animal. James describes pragmatism as a middle-ground between these two views. Under a pragmatic approach, statements are evaluated based on their practical effects. Based on this criterion, empirical facts are valuable, as they have obvious connections to everyday concerns. However, religion, or other more abstract principles, can also be useful, as they can be applied to guide decision-making in the common case where material evidence or direct knowledge is lacking. After defining pragmatism, James applies it metaphysical problems, including the concepts of truth, common sense, and free will versus determinism. Pragmatism was and remains an important philosophy. In addition to Schiller and Dewey, who applied a pragmatic approach to education and participatory democracy, many prominent thinkers have been influenced by pragmatism, including the sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois.',9.99,'/images/293f274a-880b-4f2a-b926-12311a091c6e.jpg','/files/e0f574ff-394e-4f81-9595-fae40c8ee465.epub'),

The attempts to determine whether this is true, and the aftermath, is Balzac at his wittiest. But even though she may seem like the ideal daughter, Modeste is somewhat subversive, at odds with the prevailing ideas of the time of how an ingénue should behave. Modeste Mignon, written in 1844, is one of Balzac’s last additions to the Human Comedy.',9.99,'/images/c3269707-ce2f-4be7-ab36-5570c3559425.jpg','/files/68950d86-67dc-4b00-aed6-e2e51a4ab6af.epub'),
('Lorna Doone','R. D. Blackmore','John Ridd, a young yeoman farmer, chances upon a beautiful girl in an injudicious visit to a secret valley. It’s a brief but life-defining moment, for John falls in love at first sight. Yet there are complications. That valley was the stronghold of the outlaw Doone family, and the young beauty was the prize of the clan. Beyond that, one of the Doones had, years earlier, killed John Ridd’s father. This simple encounter sets up a complex story, as there are yet more obstacles than these on the couple’s path of love. John Ridd himself narrates the book in his simple fashion. Apologizing for his many digressions even while indulging them, and protesting his honesty throughout, he tells the story of how he attempted to win the hand of Lorna Doone as his bride. The tale of romance is embedded in his many other adventures. The chronological setting is late 17th century, which saw the uprising of the Duke of Monmouth against James II. This connects with the book’s geographical setting: Exmoor, on the border of the counties of Devon and Somerset, and the heartland of support for the Monmouth rebellion. In some ways, the landscape—not solely confined to Exmoor—serves as another character in the novel. It was the setting of Blackmore’s own youth, and he knew it well. The rhythms of nature, dangerous ravines, the harsh winter of 1683–4, violent rivers, cultivated fields—all are described by the narrator with a graceful simplicity that won the admiration of Thomas Hardy, also known for his evocative prose. The literary critic Northrop Frye even perceived in these aspects of the natural world something of a mythic undertone in Blackmore’s work. The novel is generally regarded more as “historical romance” than “historical fiction,” and perhaps critically undervalued for its melodrama. It gained popularity only slowly after its first publication, but in time became a firm favorite. Its enduring appeal is attested to by its various film and television adaptations between 1912 and 2000.',9.99,'/images/f60e31e9-527b-4eb6-81cb-593668271035.jpg','/files/55a317a9-bb97-4786-9080-383e47779f93.epub'),

Castle Rackrent, her best known novel, satirizes the failures and follies of her Anglo-Irish peers, their mismanagement of their estates, and their abuse of their Irish tenants. The narrator of Castle Rackrent is Thady Quirk, whose family has served on the Rackrent estate for generations. Thady relates the life stories of four successive lords of Castle Rackrent and how their individual character and personality affect the lives and families that depend on them. Castle Rackrent was one of the first historical novels written in English, and Walter Scott later cited it as inspiration for his own Scottish historical novels.

While Mrs. Makebelieve is at work cleaning the houses of the wealthy, Mary wanders around the city and its parks absorbed in daydreams. Her encounter with a policeman who appears to signal romantic interest in her is the beginning of Mary’s coming-of-age story, which combines elements of folk- or fairytale with a complex vision of human psychology and the relations between various social groups: mothers and daughters, men and women, the rich and the poor, the young and the old. Written in 1910 and first published the following year as a serial in the short-lived Irish Review (a periodical co-founded by Stephens himself), Mary, Mary was his first published work of prose fiction. According to critic Augustine Martin, it’s the first novel written about Dublin’s slums, the squalor and despair of which Stephens had experienced first-hand in his youth. Martin suggests in his critical study of Stephens that it’s this novel, of all Stephens’ works, that most clearly articulates the driving idea of his literary career: the gap between the hard reality that human beings must endure, and the aspirations of reverie whose realization we seek through imagination.',9.99,'/images/59dde3d7-839f-4c50-ba2f-f5af728e3e1f.jpg','/files/260c851d-4133-4fb9-b7b1-cf669fa200d4.epub'),
('The Claverings','Anthony Trollope','Harry Clavering is an able, ambitious, and attractive young man, son of a country vicar and cousin to a baronet. His love for the baronet’s beautiful sister-in-law is at first reciprocated, but then rebuffed as her own ambitions incline her towards marrying a wealthy but personally repellent earl. Harry licks his wounds, and seeks to make his own fortune by training for a career as a civil engineer. While in the home of his new patrons, he meets the daughter of the head of his firm, a new love flourishes, and they become engaged. But the earl dies, and the widow, Harry’s first love, is now free—and also wealthy. Unaware of his new attachment, she seeks help from Harry, wondering whether the spark between them can be rekindled. It now transpires that Harry is also “fickle, vain, easily led, and almost as easily led to evil as to good.” Like Trollope’s Phineas Finn, The Claverings includes strong and fully realized female characters. Lady Julia Ongar is the outstanding example here, the seemingly mercenary femme fatale whose conflicting choices, hopes, and spiritual struggles are so acutely portrayed that they prevent her from simply being a stereotypical predator. Written between the last two Barchester books, The Claverings is among the very few other of Trollope’s works set in Barsetshire. The setting remains a subtle touch here: Harry’s clergyman father is annoyed by Bishop Proudie, the notorious prelate of the later Barchester series. The Trollope scholar Michael Sadleir grouped The Claverings, along with Doctor Thorne and Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite, as Trollope’s “three faultless books.” Of The Claverings itself, he found it “as surely conceived as any book [Trollope] ever wrote,” marked by “qualities of sure-footed subtlety,” especially in the many and varied acute social observations it contains—from the most intimate and intense private dramas, to more awkward and even amusing public encounters. Like many of Trollope’s books, The Claverings is “not only readable, but perpetually re-readable.”',9.99,'/images/f0438226-d475-41bb-bac8-70e372e811de.jpg','/files/f345ad64-5b3b-4add-96c3-10919a1c397c.epub'),
('Letters of Two Brides','Honoré de Balzac','Letters of Two Brides is an epistolary novel, largely consisting of letters between two women who become friends in a convent in their teenage years. They begin their correspondence when they depart the order as young women and embark on their lives in different areas of France. Louise is a woman of passion, a lover of love, who must have a great romance in order to be fulfilled. Renée is measured, a women of sense, desiring a love that will last a lifetime rather than (in her way of thinking) flame out like a comet. In several of their epistles, each takes the other to task over her approach to life and love. As their ages and respective marriages progress, it becomes obvious where Balzac’s sympathies lie. One of the later additions to The Human Comedy, Letters of Two Brides was originally serialized (and heavily bowdlerized) in the French journal La Presse in 1841, in three parts rather than two. It was not until the second edition of the novel that it was repartitioned into its present form.',9.99,'/images/6e212698-f4a0-425b-a671-4e701903e550.jpg','/files/e8ce1e9f-a6b5-43a2-8c9f-41ad54de3a93.epub'),
('Tarzan the Untamed','Edgar Rice Burroughs','Tarzan the Untamed continues the adventures of Tarzan, the orphaned child raised by apes in the African jungle. It is the seventh book in the Tarzan series and was first published as a six-part serial in The Red Book Magazine from March through August, 1919, with the story continued as “Tarzan and the Valley of Luna” in a five-part serial in Argosy All-Story Weekly in March and April, 1920. The novel was later compiled and published as a complete book in 1920 by A. C. McClurg & Co. After his estate in British East Africa is attacked by German soldiers during World War I, Tarzan embarks on a relentless quest to exact revenge upon those responsible. During his journey, Tarzan faces not only the German soldiers, but also other dangers such as wild animals, hostile tribes, and treacherous landscapes. He uses his exceptional strength, agility, and survival skills to overcome them. He also comes across a British pilot and a beautiful German spy, unexpectedly finding himself becoming both a protector and ally.',9.99,'/images/013ea89e-d529-400d-944b-930ebe28fa17.jpg','/files/d495fff4-81ff-4d8b-aff6-d78bede17777.epub'),
('The Moon Maid','Edgar Rice Burroughs','Not content with having hollowed out the center of the Earth in his earlier novels At the Earth’s Core and Pellucidar, in The Moon Maid Edgar Rice Burroughs has his hero voyage to the Moon, which also turns out to be hollow and inhabited on the inside by human-like creatures. The hero and his companion have a series of adventures there, and discover both the sophisticated Va-gas and the malevolent Kalkars. Time passes, and we turn to following the hero’s descendants as they fight against an invasion of the Earth by the Kalkars. In these episodes, the American flag has become a holy totem, uniting the human rebels. The Moon Maid was published in Argosy magazine between 1923 and 1925 as a series of three short novels, which were eventually combined into a single book edition in 1926. It was well-received by readers, and a number of critics consider it to be Burroughs’ best work of science fiction. Today it’s not as well-known as his Barsoom or Tarzan novels.',9.99,'/images/b5dfe4f0-cae8-4c91-922f-ee0867b4ce50.jpg','/files/b0ba355a-e35c-40d0-b7db-10a5080442f9.epub'),
('Early Autumn','Louis Bromfield','The Pentlands are a very conservative, old money family in a small town near Boston, who claim ancestry going back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In the fall of an unspecified year in the 1920’s, their world is invaded by several “outsiders,” including Sybil, the patriarch’s granddaughter back from a Paris education, Sabine, a prodigal niece who has returned after being gone for twenty years, together with her daughter Thérèse, and O’Hare, an Irish Catholic politician who is at odds with the deeply ingrained Protestant background of the community. As the novel progresses, it becomes increasingly clear to Olivia, Sybil’s mother, that all is not well in the Pentlands’ world; beneath the apparent calm there are secrets bubbling to the surface that have been hidden for years. It also becomes clear that with the changes taking place in the world at large and in their world in particular, the future of the Pentland family could be in peril. Before Louis Bromfield became a well-known agriculturist, he was a writer of several successful novels. This family study, which is said to be based on his wife’s Puritan upbringing, won him a Pulitzer.',9.99,'/images/3b945f30-faff-4e40-a075-1712ba37b642.jpg','/files/0d393f3d-2039-4340-9e65-e2dd34c7c725.epub'),
('Shorts from Scenes from Private Life','Honoré de Balzac','The short stories and novellas from the Scenes from Private Life portion of Balzac’s The Human Comedy represent a cross-section of French culture from the first half of the nineteenth century. There are drawing room intrigues of the rich (“Domestic Peace”), unrequited love (“The Imaginary Mistress”), a romance among the residents of a boarding house (“The Purse”), and even a Corsican vendetta (“The Vendetta”). Each of these, as well as the remaining stories in the collection, are marked by Balzac’s renowned talent for fully-realized characters, by his rich and detailed descriptions of places and people, and especially of the emotions that drive them. As a progenitor of the modern novel, he wanted to write about not only the romantic and beautiful, but also the hurtful and disturbing; in short, he wanted to write about daily French life, however good or bad it might be. Many of the characters so richly described here will be seen again and again throughout the rest of The Human Comedy.',9.99,'/images/91f08c78-fb22-4484-8cf9-9f08d8cb143f.jpg','/files/2a0e1db4-9d97-4084-b685-7fad1b63673c.epub'),
('The Rise of Silas Lapham','William Dean Howells','Silas Lapham’s long-lasting paint, made with minerals found on his family’s farm in Vermont, has helped make him a millionaire—as has hard work, ambition, and tough business sense. Now that he’s reached late middle age, he’s a success. A newspaper is writing him up in its “Solid Men of Boston” series, his family goes to seaside resorts in the summer, the scion of the aristocratic Covey family has joined his firm, his daughters have made inroads into 1880s society, and he’s even having a lavish house built in the newly-fashionable Back Bay. But it’s all too good to last. Soon the Laphams must deal with long-simmering temptations that exist because of a ruthless decision made when his company was getting off the ground. Will they avoid a fall? In 1885, when The Rise of Silas Lapham was published, William Dean Howells was in the middle of his own career. The novel remains his best-known work, enduring in no small part because of its portrayal of the self-made man and the problems that success and competition bring.',9.99,'/images/488556e6-72d9-459b-8e0e-d7e393e9b1e7.jpg','/files/d8ff40fd-7cd2-4402-9d46-ca42b6e1cc01.epub'),
('North and South','Elizabeth Gaskell','By the mid-nineteenth century, the transition of textile production in England from a cottage craft to mechanized factories was complete. Still, the effects of the industrial revolution remain distant from the idyllic rural parish in the New Forest where Margaret Hale grows up. But with her father’s crisis of conscience in ministry, the country lanes of Hampshire give way to the crowded urban streets of the industrial North of England. Mr. Hale’s new role as a private tutor brings Margaret into contact not only with her father’s favorite student—one of the “masters” of a factory—but also leads to her meeting, and caring for, the poor families of factory workers. Margaret finds her sympathies torn as she grows to understand the differing outlooks and interests of “masters and men,” especially as an industrial dispute brings the lives of both classes into crisis. But there is much more to Margaret’s life than politics and economics. An accomplished and beautiful young woman, she finds her abilities stretched by personal family tragedies, and her affections tested by differing claims on her life, both from intimate family members, and from suitors smitten by her unstudied charms. North and South would have been titled Margaret Hale, if Elizabeth Gaskell had had her way. She was overruled by Charles Dickens in whose magazine Gaskell’s novel was first serialized, and who insisted on the present title. Dynamics between the leading characters have often reminded readers of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, although in the case of Gaskell’s protagonists, these qualities are more evenly distributed. Contemporary critics were less than enthusiastic about the “women’s perspective” in the book, but appreciation has grown steadily and significantly for Gaskell’s writing and insights in North and South. Her sensitive handling of Mr. Hale’s religious scruples, her unsentimental portrayal of the urban working poor, and her prescient depiction of shifting social and gender roles all find a contemporary appeal. Although once neglected among Gaskell’s works, successive adaptations for television—the latest in 2004—have won for the book a higher profile and wider readership.',9.99,'/images/53f4f90f-480e-4e9e-a9f6-b8696f6790ff.jpg','/files/8a41d6ce-a445-4ed6-bb85-9a34e8176133.epub'),
('Terror Keep','Edgar Wallace','Mr. J. G. Reeder, employed by the Department of Public Prosecutions, has developed a reputation for solving difficult criminal cases using his unique understanding of human nature, which he calls his “criminal mind.” After a notorious bank robber and murderer escapes from prison, Mr. Reeder must match wits with Crazy John Flack, the “cleverest crook in the world,” who previously vowed to kill the famous detective in revenge for his imprisonment. Reeder’s love interest Margaret Belman receives a lucrative job offer at an exclusive country hotel located at the famous Larmes Keep. As Reeder pursues several leads on Flack’s whereabouts, he discovers that Margaret’s new position is part of Flack’s plan for revenge. When Reeder rushes to Larmes Keep in an effort to keep Margaret safe, he’s surprised to find that Crazy John is one step ahead of him. Published in 1927, Terror Keep was the third book to feature Edgar Wallace’s answer to Sherlock Holmes.',9.99,'/images/e1298fff-010a-4d56-b04d-9401b938c19d.jpg','/files/132ab099-7e21-4bd1-89ef-b374e3b02ae6.epub'),
('The Gold Bat','P. G. Wodehouse','Trevor, the captain of the Wrykyn football team, finds his schoolboy honor in jeopardy when a miniature gold bat known to be in his keeping is misplaced in the course of a prank executed by O’Hara, the irrepressible Irishman. Trevor, O’Hara, and others must find the bat to preserve Trevor’s honor, while also ensuring Wrykyn’s victory in football over their arch-rival Ripton, and suffering increasingly audacious attacks from the sinister and anonymous League. The Gold Bat is one of P. G. Wodehouse’s earliest works, and the first of several set at the fictional boys’ public school Wrykyn. It was originally serialized in The Captain magazine and later published by A & C Black, London.',9.99,'/images/1da5d6f2-9697-4820-bacf-85e390105cfb.jpg','/files/a556a5af-7a74-4527-b213-d1616755d26d.epub'),
('Search the Sky','Frederik Pohl','After noticing that interstellar spaceships are bypassing their destination planets because they’re not able to contact the inhabitants on arrival, a man is sent out to investigate what is happening to humanity. Traveling faster than light, he visits several worlds in his attempt to find the answer, including a world where age determines rank, a world where women are dominant and men are jailed for life for even suggesting the genders should be equal, a world where everyone has converted to a cult dedicated to the world’s original settler, and Earth itself. Originally published in 1954, Search the Sky is the second collaboration between Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth. The story is a satirical cautionary tale, exaggerating trends the authors saw in our own world. The pair would ultimately publish six novels and several short stories before Kornbluth’s death in 1958. Contemporary critics gave the book a positive reception, though they generally found the pair’s first collaboration, The Space Merchants, to be the stronger book. Search the Sky was reprinted in 1977, at which point Spider Robinson, writing in Galaxy magazine in September 1977, credited Pohl and Kornbluth with inspiring an “explosion” of satirical science fiction, adding that Pohl and Kornbluth “didn’t invent the notion of extrapolating-beyond-the-point-of-absurdity—but they gave it a quantum jump in sophistication, in relevance, hooked it into an enormously more subtle social consciousness—and gave it a bite like an angry chainsaw.”',9.99,'/images/694e38e8-9d61-4211-b102-91a82ecd7712.jpg','/files/876aa6e2-4e88-4786-8fb4-90ada9261592.epub')
